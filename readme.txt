--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

9/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 1/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
	The basic features I included were adding at least 1 image with descriptive alt attributes, adding appropriate headings and 
	paragraph text, and multiple pages, with appropriate navigation.


(b) CSS features
	The CSS features I included were leveraging bootstrap CSS helpers which in this case was the bootstrap grid system. I also included moddifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability.


(c) Advanced features

	The advanced features I added were adding a table with multiple columns and rows, for two of my html files and embedded HTML5 media such as videos to the columns.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

	In terms of days I started early, so it took about a week, but in temrs of hours I invested about 3 to 4 ish hours a week. During those times, I also started 
	some mroe html and css tutorials, so it did take a while to get used to these languages. 

4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
	https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html (up to forms )
	https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css (up to box model)
	https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
	I consulted my friend who recently got a job as a web developer. I asked him if he recommended I use a single css file for multipel htmls or one css per html. He recommended that 
	I use multiple as it would be much easier to manage.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
	No
