           Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Ivan Kim and I am currently an undergraduate at the univeristy of California Irvine. I am currently a 4th year majoring in Computer Game Science and plan to graduate in June of 2021.<br><br> As an aspiring game designer and programmer, I love to learn new things and prototype different kinds of games. I love to create character concepts that are based on the Blizzard videogame Overwatch. I hope you take a look at my resume and my Project OW.
