            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Moth <br>
              <strong>Bio:</strong> Moth is a current Talon combat medic leader. Taking over his fathers position he now leads his fathers old division into battle. He see's no issue with the work Talon does, and always vows to complete the tasks that are handed to him. However, he does have some morality as he makes sure no innocent civillians are killed. He only considers this a job and that killing should only be done if its abolutley necessary. Despite this, if anyone gets in the way of the mission he won't stop to kill them.
