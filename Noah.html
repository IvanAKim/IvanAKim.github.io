            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Noah <br>
              <strong>Bio:</strong> Noah is the son of Overwatches Rescue Captain Lamech. Lamech was known to be the kindest member of Overwatch, always completing his missions with a smile. Known for his smile, Noah always strived to be like his father and always waited for him at the door for his return. However, one day the only thing that came through that door were his fathers belongings. Very little details were made to the public. Rumors soon spread that Overwatch was responsible for Lamechs death and that the former Rescue Captain was left behind. Now with the return of Overwatch, Noah's wounds reopened. With his fathers trusty winchester and stopwatch he plans to make sure Overwatch stays as history. With a smile on his face Noah seeks to find the members, starting with the one that was with his father during the mission....Reinhardt.
