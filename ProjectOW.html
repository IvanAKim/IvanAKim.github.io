      				<p>Description</p>
					<p>Project OW is a project that is currently in development. The goal of this project is to develop and program character concepts based on the video game known as Overwatch. These character concepts will have unique abilities, weapons, and lore. I am currently planning to create at least 6 different chracter concepts, with there being at least 2 character concepts per classes(tank, damage, support). The idea for this project started out in 2016 around the release of Overwatch. I fell in love with the game from the start and the thing I loved about the game was the unique heroes that were avalaible to play along with their lore. Throughout my time playing I stared to write down my own ideas for character concepts. So, I decided later on in college that I would try to bring my concepts to life.
